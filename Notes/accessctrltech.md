# Access Control Technologies

Access control prevents unauthorized users from viewing, changing, or controlling an object. It depends on other processes such as:

- Identity establishment
- Authentication process
- Privilege granting, verification, and revocation

## Strong Authentication

Also called multifactor authentication. Uses more than one authentication factor or type.

*Examples*

- ATM card and PIN
- Password and DUO push
- Fingerprint and password

## Access Provisioning Life Cycle

- Password policy compliance checking. Account inactivity, password expiration, password changes.

- Revoke access when contracts expire like termination or movement.

## Credential Management Systems

Password managers may offer:

- Secure password generation
- Secure password storage
- Reducing the number of passwords users need to remember
- Multifactor authentication to unlock credentials
- Audit logging of interactions

## Discretionary Access Control

**Owners have full control over assets.** User errors can expose confidential data.


## Mandatory Access Control

Expensive and difficult to implement.

*Subjects have clearance. Objects have labels.*

- Typically confidential, secret, and top-secret


## Non-Discretionary Access Control

Role-Based access control, Task-Based access control

Users don't have discretion when accessing objects. Users can't transfer objects.
