#Critical Infrastructure Protection and Security

Systems so vital that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, or national public health or safety.

*Examples:*

- Energy
- Food and Agriculture
- Transportation
- Information Technology

##Government Critical Infrastructures

- National Security
  - Electric Grid
  - Financial
  - Nuclear / Biological

- National Economy
  - Financial
  - Communications
  - Transportation

##Business Critical Infrastructures

- Business Operations
- Financial
- Supply Chain
- Business Reputation

##Public Critical Infrastructure Concerns

- Electric / Water supply
- Banking
- Communications
- Transportation

##Threats to Infrastructure

- Traditional Physical Threats
  - Destruction, damage, disruption
  - Natural, accidental, deliberate
- Traditional Cyber Threats
  - Accidental breach
  - External hacks
  - Denial of Service
  - Virus, worm
- Cyber-Physical Threats
  - Combination of threats that build on each other or increase susceptibility to other threats

##Critical Vulnerabilities in Infrastructure

- Infrastructure is decades old with no modernization in sight
- Interconnectedness leads to increased and unintended vulnerability
- Inadequate security practices

##Who is Responsible for Fixing Vulnerabilities

**Government agencies**
- Sector Specific Agency Responsibilities
  - Encourage information sharing and encourage development of programs
  - Promote education
  - Identify, prioritize, and coordinate CIP activities
  - Inform congress of status and progress
  - Increase integration of cyber security efforts
  - Develop and implement sector risk management program
  - Support DHS data calls
  - Promote cyber awareness

##Public-Private Partnership

Voluntary alliance between industry and government
- Foundation of CIP

**Sector Coordinating Councils**
Companies coordinating with the government

**Government Coordinating Councils**
Government counterpart to SCCs to help coordinate cross-sector

##Types of Critical Infrastructure

**Core**: Communications, power, water
- Significant failure means crisis within hours
- Limited or no reserve in case of failure

**Essential**: Banking, transportation, public health
- Failure means crisis within days
- Some reserve in case of failure

**Public Confidence**: If public confidence fails the infrastructure fails

##Critical Infrastructure Characteristics

**85-90% of critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector**

Therefore CIP depends on voluntary partnerships

*Strategic Fragility*
- Increasing reach of infrastructure
- Interdependence of infrastructure
- Increasing importance of cyber infrastructure

**Need resiliency and redundancy**
